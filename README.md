## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Brain Components

#### üß† AI Brain (`src/brain.py`)
The central nervous system that coordinates all components:
- Command processing and understanding
- Task detection and planning
- Memory management and learning
- Knowledge integration
- Task execution monitoring

#### üó£Ô∏è Command Processor (`src/command_processor.py`)
Processes natural language commands like the language centers of the brain:
- Intent recognition and classification
- Entity extraction and understanding
- Pattern learning and improvement
- Context awareness

#### ‚ö° Task Executor (`src/task_executor.py`)
Executes tasks like the motor cortex:
- File operations (create, open, delete, etc.)
- Web operations (search, download, etc.)
- System operations (install, run, monitor)
- Data operations (analyze, convert, backup)
- Communication tasks (email, scheduling)

#### üß† Memory Manager (`src/memory_manager.py`)
Manages memory like the hippocampus:
- Short-term memory (working memory)
- Long-term memory (persistent storage)
- Memory consolidation and optimization
- Memory search and retrieval

#### üß† Knowledge Base (`src/knowledge_base.py`)
Stores and manages knowledge like the cerebral cortex:
- Factual knowledge storage
- Conceptual knowledge organization
- Reasoning rules and patterns
- Learning from interactions

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for configuration:
```env
# Logging level
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Memory settings
MEMORY_DIR=data/memory
KNOWLEDGE_DIR=data/knowledge

# Task execution settings
MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=5
TASK_TIMEOUT=300
```

### Customization
You can customize the AI assistant by:
- Adding new task types in `src/task_executor.py`
- Extending command patterns in `src/command_processor.py`
- Modifying memory settings in `src/memory_manager.py`
- Adding knowledge rules in `src/knowledge_base.py`

## üìä Monitoring and Statistics

### Brain Status
View comprehensive brain statistics:
```bash
python main.py --status
```

This shows:
- Consciousness, energy, and focus levels
- Current tasks and total interactions
- Knowledge items and memory usage
- Recent activity and performance metrics

### Logging
The system provides detailed logging:
- Command processing logs
- Task execution logs
